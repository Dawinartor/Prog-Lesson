All steps to use and activate the back-end have been documented and carefully written down. All dependencies are available as a Github repo and must be installed locally once as RectJS.

# The backend code:
[`https://github.com/Dawinartor/Prog-Lesson/tree/master/ReactJS/connect-back-to-front`](https://github.com/Dawinartor/Prog-Lesson/tree/master/ReactJS/connect-back-to-front)

In order to use the Docker container, further steps need to be taken. The containers have to be set up manually and connected to the local machine to be used with the back-end.

Finally, there is a list of the division of labour between the backend and the frontend.
